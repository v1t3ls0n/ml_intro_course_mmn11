    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "This notebook compares the performance of two variants of the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) on the MNIST digit classification task:\n",
    "- **Clean PLA:** Standard perceptron without enhancements.\n",
    "- **Pocket PLA:** Enhanced perceptron that stores the best-performing weights during training (using the Pocket algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**  \n",
    "- MNIST dataset consisting of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.\n",
    "- The images are normalized to the range [0, 1] and a bias term is added, resulting in input samples with 785 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation Metrics:**  \n",
    "- **Confusion Matrices:** Provides a detailed view of how well each digit is classified.\n",
    "- **Overall Accuracy (ACC):** Defined as \\(\\text{ACC} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\\).\n",
    "- **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate, TPR):** For each digit, calculated as \\(\\text{TPR} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\\), showing the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify the digit.\n",
    "- **Selectivity (Specificity, TNR):** For each digit, calculated as \\(\\text{TNR} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\\), showing the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify negatives.\n",
    "- **Training and Testing Error Curves:** Visualized as a function of iteration for detailed analysis of learning dynamics.\n",
    "- **Runtime:** The time taken to train the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**  \n",
    "- Evaluate and compare the model accuracy and robustness between Clean PLA and Pocket PLA.\n",
    "- Analyze and visualize the performance through confusion matrices, error curves, and summary plots (accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, and runtime vs. the number of iterations).\n",
    "- Provide a comprehensive discussion on how training iterations affect the decision boundaries and the overall performance, particularly in the one-vs-all classification setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook integrates detailed quantitative evaluation with comprehensive visualizations to thoroughly analyze the multi-class Perceptron performance on the MNIST dataset."
